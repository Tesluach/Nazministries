            Warm Christian greetings to you, and welcome to The Church of the Nazarene South Sudan in Uganda website!
            “Where People Matter and Grow in Christ Together.”
          </p>

            Church of the Nazarene, we are a Protestant, Evangelical in the Wesleyan-Holiness Tradition. Organized in
            1908, we are a Great commission Church (Matthew 28:19-20), presented in 162 countries!
            Church of the Nazarene is the Christian church, as we know it today, came into being following the
            crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This happened in the first half of the first century
            subsequent to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost as reported in Acts 2. Within less
            than 300 years the Christian movement became the most powerful force in the Roman world. In the year 323,
            Christianity became the official religion of the Empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Middle Ages, several Christian reform movements arose. In the 16th century, the Protestant
            Reformation led by people like Martin Luther and John Calvin gave birth to many of the Christian
            denominations we know today. In the early 18th century, an Evangelical Revival swept across England. That
            revival was fueled by evangelist George Whitefield and the ministry of two brothers, John and Charles
            Wesley. The Wesleys emphasized the possibility of a victorious life through the indwelling presence of the
            Holy Spirit. The preaching, teaching, follow up work and social ministries of the Wesleys gave birth to the
            Methodist movement.
